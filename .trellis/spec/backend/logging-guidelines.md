# Logging Guidelines

> How logging is done in this project.

---

## Overview

<!--
Document your project's logging conventions here.

Questions to answer:
- What logging library do you use?
- What are the log levels and when to use each?
- What should be logged?
- What should NOT be logged (PII, secrets)?
-->

Use concise structured `console.info`/`console.error` output at process boundaries
until the application logging module is introduced. Never log access tokens, app
secrets, full Feishu payloads, or personal snapshots.
